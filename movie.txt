1.a) Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the movie, a String representing the studio, and a String representing the rating as its arguments, and sets the respective class properties to these values.

code - 
class Movie {                                   //created class as Movie
    constructor (title, studio, rating){        //created constructor for class Movie with title , studio and rating as properties
        this.title = title;
        this.studio = studio;
        this.rating = rating; 
    }
}
let movie1 = new Movie("Spirited Away", "Ghibil Studio", "PG");        //creted method with property values
let movie2 = new Movie('The Gray Man', "Netflix", "PG-13");

console.log(movie1, movie2)

output - 
Movie { title: 'Spirited Away', studio: 'Ghibil Studio', rating: 'PG' }  Movie { title: 'The Gray Man', studio: 'Netflix', rating: 'PG-13' }

1.b) The constructor for the class Movie will set the class property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided.

code- 

class Movie {                                                           //created class as Movie
    constructor (title, studio, rating="PG"){                           //setting PG as default value for rating property
        this.title = title;
        this.studio = studio;
        this.rating = rating; 
    }
}
let movie1 = new Movie("Spirited Away", "Ghibil Studio");
let movie2 = new Movie('The Gray Man', "Netflix", "PG-13");

console.log(movie1, movie2)

output -
Movie { title: 'Spirited Away', studio: 'Ghibil Studio', rating: 'PG' } Movie { title: 'The Gray Man', studio: 'Netflix', rating: 'PG-13' }

1.d)  Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Movie with the title “Casino Royale”, the studio “Eon Productions”, and the rating “PG­13”.

code- 
class Movie{                                                        //created class as Movie
    constructor(title,studio,rating='PG'){                              
        this.title=title;
        this.studio=studio;
        this.rating=rating;
    }

}
var movie1= new Movie('Casino Royale','Eon Productions','PG13');    //creted method with property values

console.log(movie1);

output-
Movie {
  title: 'Casino Royale',
  studio: 'Eon Productions',
  rating: 'PG13'
}
